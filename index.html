            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              Hey, welcome to math / mathematic tutor. My name is Voldi Muyumba and I am a math and tech enthusiast. I attended Troyeville Primary School and then went to Barnato Park High School. In primary school, I had struggled with maths to the point where I eventually lost passion for every
              other subject. Because of this struggle, I ended up failing and repeating grade 6. My life was shattered but I did not despair because I had a plan in mind. I planned to focus on mathematics and I believed that by passing mathematics my confidence will be boosted and I will eventually
              start passing other subjects as well. I did get help from legions of people in my second year in grade 6. At the end of that year, I got an award for being the most improved learner. This award did tremendously have a significant impact on my life and made me realize that with math I
              can do anything.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ever since I got that award I have never gotten anything less than a distinction or an A for mathematics and I have since been helping/assisting my peers and family with mathematics. In my school journey, I did meet significant figures that inspired and made me who I am and I did learn
              a lot of tricks and tips from them which I will take to the grave. Mr Smith my primary school maths teacher, Mr Mapfumo my FET math teacher and Mr Booi my advanced math teacher. I am currently studying applied mathematics and computer science at universty.
            </p>

            <p>If you or you have/know someone that needs help with maths, feel free to get in touch with me. I would be honoured to help/teach that someone mathematics and also give them tips and tricks which I have picked up throughout my maths journey.</p>
